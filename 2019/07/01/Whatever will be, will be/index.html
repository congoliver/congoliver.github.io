        <p>College student Orange’s recent small goal is to buy the latest iPhone in installments, which will make her feel that she is the most awkward girl in the bedroom. Colleague Mango wants to enter a well-known sports car before the end of the year because he knows he can’t afford a line. The existence of the sports car can make him better in the nightclub sisters, leading the bananas to buy a house in the East Third Ring Road, but the development of the company and the school of the baby are like two big stones, which makes him breathless. The boss of the listed company dreams of staggering with the more senior wealthy businessmen, and is annoyed that they do not know how to deal with these elites. The desire of the top wealthy businessmen and politicians is to make their family industry evergreen, and they will not be lost for generations. joke.<br><a id="more"></a><br>The uncles of the college students’ oranges are proud of their prostitutes. Everyone praises their niece for a long time. It is the only dawn and hope of the whole village. The mother’s flower roll of Mango’s far away can only be seen on New Year’s Eve. The son once, but she felt that she was able to cultivate a baby who could be alone in the big company. She was proud enough. The children of the same age in the square dance, who knows more about mango? Banana’s daughter-in-law peaches always persuade her husband to pay attention to the body. It is important for a family to be healthy and healthy than to earn money. Rich businessmen and politicians talk and laugh at major speeches and encourage young people to pursue their dreams. But what young people don’t know is that A few months later, someone was jailed.</p>
<p>In fact, the real imprisonment of a young person is often not a success, but a self.<br>It is the back-and-forth confrontation between inner desire and individual ability. It is the final reconciliation of secular values ​​and self-exploration. It is a proposition that you need to spend a lifetime to enlighten.<br>A teenager who once wanted to squander Fang Fang on Wall Street, and later worked as an accountant in a small county institution, a girl who stayed up late in the serious literary world, and later became a housewife who occasionally gave poems to the laundry for cooking and cooking. Most people This is true for a lifetime. You said that he did not achieve his dreams, but you looked at him and his family, lucky laughter and self-satisfaction. Why do you deny their value?</p>
<p>Our young generation, including myself, always has a very good attitude. Life is not the life you want, you are not the one you want to be. But if you really want to think about it, most of these unhappiness seems to be unnecessary. For example, the expectations of parents, the pressure of relatives and friends, and the comparison with others that are unnecessary.<br>A few days ago, I saw a teacher from the Iraqi war correspondent, Ante, at a banquet. The words he said gave me a deep impression. The general idea is: If you feel that you have worked hard, it is still very hard, so let Relax yourself, let go of yourself, not your attitude is a problem, but your strategy.</p>
<p>I think so. In this world, there are always people who tell you to work harder, to be faster, or else you will not be able to catch up with others and you will be eliminated. But no one has ever told you, where is the effort to be a head? I’m almost halfway to work hard, can’t I stop doing it? The way I work hard must be the same as everyone else? nobody. Because they don’t know you, don’t know what you want, they won’t let you know about yourself. Over time, you forget who you are and what you want to do.</p>
<p>The Temple of Apollo in the ancient Greek city of Delphi is engraved with seven profound words: <em>Man, know yourself. </em> Socrates is “self-awareness” as his own research. Because of this, it has never been an easy task. This is a process that requires constant refreshing of cognition and trial and error. It requires a lot of reflection, practice, observation and thinking. If you have never known yourself and don’t know what you want, then even if you have achieved the success of the secular definition, you can’t live your own way.<br>Anything you want to give to a young man who has nothing to do? What I want to say is: Nothing in my opinion is a false proposition.</p>
<p>Don’t listen to the sound of wearing forest leaves, you just take your way, this road may have doubts, pain and deviation, but you don’t panic, this is a necessity of practice. Don’t let the eyes of outsiders become your tie, and don’t let the definition of the world become your burden. Of course, I don’t mean that you have to be independent. You should be able to get along with them. Just you have to know that these should not be the weight of your value. We have all been eager to return home, and we have seen Changan flowers in one day. In the end, we discovered the greatest achievement. It is nothing more than living in the heart.</p>
